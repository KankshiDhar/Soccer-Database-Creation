# Soccer-Database-Creation

We started by creating a conceptual design of a football requirement database.Thedatabase that we have created has various tables and
multiple attributes addressing player strengths, player positions, player height, stats which would refer skill moves, 
player age by birth year, ratings etc., We have essentially created a database that can track the football universe and be used to 
find player rankings, team rankings amongst Leagues and National team matches. The database can answer questions for 
players, teams, leagues, clubs, match statistics and which countries participated in leagues and the respective wins and losses
and goal differences as well.  
 
The two important wings of use for this database would involve 
- the statistical side 
- the daily-application side. 

The statistical-facts wing brings with itself information for football enthusiasts, followers for player awards, 
positions etc. and the people-application wing would encompass usage for scouts who can use this data to bid on players or 
people who use this information to bet on matches after accessing team by team analysis etc. 
Entities we have not included in the database are player images, player histories, player contract details and 
other details which might lead to copyright or privacy violations.
